Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment
Continuous integration means that whatever code you write and push to the CI branch of your server is automatically tested and integrated into your existing code.
Of course, this implies that you have written your unit tests and integration tests before hand and configured your CI system to run these tests.
Continuous deployment is an extension of the idea of CI wherein, your continuous development system is automatically packaging up your entire app and pushing it onto a test server, installing the app on the test server and running the app on the test server.
Oh and all throughout the major steps of the processes CI and CD, you should be able to receive emails or messages about how they are going.
